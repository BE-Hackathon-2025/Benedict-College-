Food4All
Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
How do we help with the lack of food availability for everyone

Project Description 🤯
Food4All is a comprehensive mobile application designed to combat food insecurity by connecting users with local food resources and providing intelligent meal solutions. The app features a food bank locator that uses GPS technology to show nearby food banks with detailed information including hours, available food, and directions via Google Maps integration. Additionally, Food4All includes an innovative "Snap-to-Recipe" feature that uses Claude AI to analyze photos of ingredients and generate personalized recipe recommendations based on what users have available. The platform also offers dietary customization options, allowing users to filter resources and recipes based on specific preferences like vegan, gluten-free, or other dietary restrictions.

Project Value 💰
The primary target audience for Food4All includes individuals and families affected by food insecurity, particularly those impacted by recent budget cuts and limited access to affordable nutrition. The app provides tangible benefits by eliminating the traditional barriers to finding food assistance - users can quickly locate nearby food banks with real-time information and get instant recipe ideas for whatever ingredients they have available. For food banks and community organizations, Food4All serves as a digital outreach tool that increases their visibility and helps them serve more people efficiently. The AI-powered recipe generator also helps reduce food waste by providing creative ways to use available ingredients, making limited resources stretch further while promoting nutritional education.
